Hi there!

My name is Mateus, I'm a brazilian software developer for 7 years and during my
journey I've worked - and still am - mostly with banking systems, like Banco da 
Amaz√¥nia, CAIXA, Sicoob and Central Bank of Brazil, as a full stack developer,
but today my main focus is on building backend applications.

Today I live in Sweden and here had the opportunity to work with embedded 
Android systems on Volvo machines for 1 year, but now I'm back to the bank apps
as a developer for Klarna, a Swedish fintech with big participation on a lot of
european countries, as well as in the United States and Australia.

As a kid I wished to be a mechanic, and even did 2 years of mechanical 
engineering, but there I had a class of introduction to programming. I
immediately got hooked to it and later I've changed to computer science.

My wife says that I am still a mechanic, but now fixing code instead :)
I do like to search, review, fix bugs and tests. Gives me lot of joy!

Working in banks can usually go without that many changes, so I'm looking for
opportunities of doing "work after work", to have a way to use all my experience
and passion for solving problems to help you with yours. If you have any 
software that can use some love, please don't hesitate to get in touch.
